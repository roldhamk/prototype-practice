## Prototype Practice 

Three challenges - to convert JS objects from class/subclass to function prototypes to demonstrate understanding of the theory behind class/subclasses.

Files include: 

* prototype-parking.js
* prototype-pet.js
* prototype1.js

Each file contains noted code at the top that show the original class/subclass code to be converted.
